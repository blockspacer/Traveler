Street Lines Overlay Pack
v1.0
----

These textures were made for UFO: Alien Invasion and are licensed under GNU GPL 2 or later.

Each file can be layered over the top of a concrete texture to create street lines. There are horizontal lines, turns, crosswalks (zebra stripes), parking spaces and even a bus stop.

IMPORTANT:
----------
Your base concrete texture should be 256x256 and tile. There are separate overlays for horizontal and vertical streets. This is because the base texture should NOT be rotated. As long as the base texture tiles, is never rotated and you build in chunks no smaller than the smallest overlay (256x256), then the textures will perfectly tile with the overlays.
